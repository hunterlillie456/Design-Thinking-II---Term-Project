# Design-Thinking-II---Term-Project
Purpose The objectives of this project are: 1. To promote group work and the sharing of ideas and tasks. 2. To promote life-long learning. 3. To empower students with the opportunity to realize that they are capable of attaining skill sets on their own with some effort. 4. To learn how to employ design thinking to innovate and create 5. To design and implement a project that requires developing skills in programming as well as some aspects of engineering. Project Requirement Hacking makes up a small part of the video gaming industry revenue went up 20% in 2020 to $180 billion1 , most of the revenue (about $87 billion) is in the mobile market. Console sales were up almost 20%, PC games up by 11%, and mobile games up by 24%; COVID-19 fuels all this! In hopes of making you all rich, the design challenge this semester is to design a 2D action-based video game that incorporates the binary number system, binary arithmetic, or binary representation! The game design will follow the design thinking process, and development will use the SCRUM methodology. Groups will prototype the game via the Greenfoot platform, a Java-based 2D gaming platform. The process will involve but is not limited to • Researching and game idea • Developing the problem statement • “How might we” questions • Storyboards and design document • Using collaboration approaches to implement the game
